## A marketplace mobile app

\*\*\*Please note this app is created using Expo and it does not support iOS mobile devices for viewing. Also, to view on a mobile device will require you to download the Expo app first. More details in the link below.

\*\*\*To view in the browser click the link below -> click 'Open project in the browser' -> click 'Open project' -> in the emulator click 'Open Project Using Expo'

Choose to view the app in the browser or on your mobile [here](https://expo.io/@peanutz/projects/eMarketplace)

### Context

This app is built using React Native and Redux. My intention is to reverse engineer an app called [Karrot](https://uk.karrotmarket.com/)- a marketplace. Chat, share and some functionalities under 'My Account' are unavailable because the purpose of this app is to demonstrate how state is maintained using Redux.

### To navigate

Your username is Tony once you are on the app. The app includes:

-Home-

- Tap the orange sell button to post an item that you would like to sell
- Search items by text and filter results (e.g. dress or makeup)
- Search users by member ID (e.g. 222 or 333)
- Customize your feeds by category
- Scroll and view items posted by others
- Tap an item to view its details
- Favourite an item (see all favorite items under my account tab)
- Tap the seller's profile picture to view seller's reviews and/or rate the seller
- Tap the three dots icon to block or hide the seller (all items or search results from this seller would not appear if they are blocked. Hidden items will appear in search results but not on your feeds)
- View seller's other items

-Category-

- View all items for sale under a selected category

-My Account-

- Change your profile picture and name by tapping the camera icon
- Tap view profile for a list of your active, sold, hidden items and toggle their statuses

### Potential future features

1. Location settings
2. Chat
3. Share
4. App settings

### Road blocks

The app was meant to operate on an iOS device. However, as I have mentioned Expo does not support viewers on iOS (I goofed,I know!). I will be fixing incompatibilities that occur when viewing on an Android device/emulator.

_Updates_
All known incompatibilities have been fixed.
